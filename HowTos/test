**A few important notes before we launch the instance:**

1. This document complements the existing deployment guide that was designed to help you to associate a Palo Alto VM-Series. We are going to assume that you have completed all the steps from 1 to 6 before launching this firewall instance. Step 7a is not necessary as it is Palo Alto VM-Series specific.

2. Currently we do not have a full integration between the Aviatrix dashboard and the CloudGuard, which means that you will not be able to update the firewall routing table via API, as it is currently possible with the Palo Alto VM-Series.
